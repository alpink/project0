 			 			<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>
						Bell ringing is fascinating! It requires both physical 
						coordination and mental agility. When I started the 
						physical aspects of controlling a bell were much harder 
						than I expected and even after a few years practise 
						it requires a high level of concentration to ring 
						accurately.</p>

						<h3>About this Site </h3>
						<p>There are three sections accessed by using the 
						navigation on the left hand side. A summary of the 
						sections follows.</p>
						<p>Once a beginner gets used to controlling a bell when 
						ringing solo, the next stage is to ring <strong>rounds
						</strong>with others. </p>
						<p>The next stage often involves <strong>call changes</strong>. </p>
						<p>Finally a ringer starts to learn <strong>methods</strong>. 
						The simplest method is known as Plain Hunt. </p>

 			 			<h3>Terminology</h3>
						<p>Here are some terms you will frequently come across 
						whilst you are ringing: </p>
							<ul>
								<li> Each stroke is long and smooth allowing small effort over a long distance giving good control of the bell.
										Beginners frequently have the tendency to yank the bell hard and then let go too early, which does not allow
										a smooth flow or good control.
							
								<li> The 'Tail stroke', or 'Back stroke' requires even less effort than the 'Hand Stroke' and for steady ringing,
										only needs to maintain the tension of the rope. If it is necessary to haul hard on the 'Back Stroke'
										in order to avoid hitting the stay, then the 'Hand Stroke' has been pulled too hard and should be gradually
										adjusted until the bell only hovers on the balance point.
							
								<li> Both hands are adjacent. On the 'Hand Stroke' the hand holding the tail is just below the other hand.
							
								<li> When releasing the 'Hand Stroke' at the bottom of the pull, the upper hand immediately joins the hand
										holding the tail, again just above it.
							
								<li> The 'Sally' is caught at the lowest point of its return and the hands will rise with the onward travel
										of the bell to the top of the 'Hand Stroke', where it should be at the balance point
										and can then be smoothly pulled back with minimal effort. If it is necessary to haul hard on the 'Sally'
										to prevent hitting the stay, then the amount of pull on the 'Back Stroke' should be gradually reduced
										until the balance point hover is achieved on this stroke too.
							
								<li> When catching the 'Sally' the tail should be between the 'Sally' and the ringer in the crook of the thumb
										and forefinger with the same hand comfortably holding the 'Sally'.
							
								<li> When holding the 'Sally', all of the fingers are comfortably around the 'Sally' with the thumbs completing the hold,
										in the same way as a handle would be held. Beginners sometimes have the tendency to hang on to the 'Sally' with
										a few fingers in a claw like grasp.
							</ul>
